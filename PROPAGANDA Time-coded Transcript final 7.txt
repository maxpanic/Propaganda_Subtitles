the world's greatest adventure in advertising."00:41:56,00:42:06His immediate job was to convince the pacifist American people that a war some 4,000 miles away was worth fighting, even though American soil was not threatened. 00:42:10,00:42:16.900Hollywood helped this cause by exploiting a weekly film audience of 80 million with titles such as: 00:42:17,00:42:19'The Hun Within'00:42:19,00:42:21'The Kaiser' 00:42:21,00:42:23'The Beast of Burden'00:42:23,00:42:25and 'The Claws of the Hun'00:42:25,00:42:29which all suggested that the German threat was right on American soil.00:42:37,00:42:45The process worked so well that Americans learned to hate German civilians almost as much as the targeted German government00:42:46,00:42:55and just six months after his re-election on a 'Stay out of The War' pledge, President Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany. 00:43:03,00:43:07 One week later, the US set up its own propaganda organization: 00:43:08,00:43:11the Committee on Public Information00:43:12,00:43:20which became so successful that it continues to this day as the United States Information Agency.00:43:23,00:43:26While the British abandoned propaganda in peacetime00:43:26,00:43:35the Americans maintained its use under the leadership of Creel Commission psychologist Edward Bernays00:43:38,00:43:46who argued that American public opinion must be engineered from above by society's few masters 00:43:47,00:43:49the 1%00:43:50,00:43:53to control the rabble. 00:43:54,00:44:00His first experiment was to convince American women that smoking was glamorous and liberating00:44:00,00:44:06despite common fears that smoking was associated with prostitution. 00:44:08,00:44:12He did this by hiring models to march in New York's Easter Parade00:44:12,00:44:19each holding a lit cigarette and wearing a banner proclaiming it a "torch of liberty". 00:44:23,00:44:28The business world then turned to Bernays to indoctrinate citizens with the capitalist story00:44:28,00:44:39until the masses willingly adopted the idea that America is a country "of big business, by big business, and for big business." 00:44:42,00:44:53"Fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power" - Benito Mussolini00:44:56,00:45:04.900Meanwhile, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels was openly thanking the British and Americans for their propaganda model 00:45:05,00:45:09and put it to good use for rallying the German people to war. 00:45:11,00:45:16>>GOEBBELS: Do you want, if possible...00:45:16,00:45:22Even more total, more radical war than we can even dream of?00:45:29,00:45:38>>NARRATOR: Historical documents prove that Goebbels ordered stormtroopers to burn down the German Reichstag, which he blamed on the Communists. 00:45:41,00:45:47This had the desired effect of frightening the population who surrendered their civil rights 00:45:47,00:45:56and enabled the Nazis to swiftly transform Germany from Republic to Fascist State and launch WW2. 00:46:00,00:46:04Cover Ups and Omissions00:46:09,00:46:16.50035 million lives were given up in WW2 in patriotic fervour created by propaganda campaigns. 00:46:17,00:46:29.500>>NEWSREEL: Australia marches with Britain!Land of plenty.

01:26:30,01:26:33符合泰拉·班克斯小姐01:26:33,01:26:36.500一个以前的衣服模型，现在拥有一档脱口秀节目 01:26:37,01:26:41她假装关心人的问题和社会普遍01:26:41,01:26:44即使她没有资格做到这一点。 01:26:47,01:26:53在这里，她打扮起来，假装是为了体验生活在街道上的无家可归者01:26:53,01:26:58这是不可能的，因为她拥有众多的家园和巨大的财富。01:27:00,01:27:04观众不怀疑这个把戏 01:27:06,01:27:10而是心甘情愿馈入她的需要谈论自己。 01:27:12,01:27:16在这里，我们看到美国的超级模特新秀大赛01:27:16,01:27:19这里的一切是包括在她的泰拉品牌。 01:27:19,01:27:25每个人都有呼喊和尖叫，显得非常高兴，一提到她的名字。01:27:28,01:27:35In this episode she has the contestants made up to pose as blood-splattered and mangled corpses01:27:35,01:27:39同时世界的另一边，她的美国同胞们，射击，刺， 01:27:39,01:27:45和炸毁了一个估计有180万伊拉克平民。 01:27:48,01:27:53像大多数美国人一样，她不知道或关心这些数字。 01:27:54,01:27:57她只关心只一个物质生活的风格。01:28:02,01:28:06恐怖主义01:28:07,01:28:13现在有比历史上任何时候都更多的宣传填充屏幕和杂志 01:28:13,01:28:19这些控制由五个巨大的媒体公司。 01:28:20,01:28:25这将创造更多的机会，转移国内民众的真正重要的东西。 01:28:27,01:28:30有更多的机会进行洗脑的人。 01:28:30,01:28:36有更多的机会向他们出售毒食品和药品，他们并不需要。 01:28:37,01:28:43.500更多机会，滴喂它们毫无意义的，歪曲事实，...01:28:47,01:28:52不，这不是好莱坞大片。 01:28:55,01:28:58飞机撞毁塔是真实的 01:28:58,01:29:04而这些建筑物坠落到地面，包括是不是碰上什么。 01:29:05,01:29:12.500美国人口，恐吓，催眠，受到创伤重复看房的破坏， 01:29:13,01:29:19与媒体重复一遍又一遍，这是一起恐怖袭击。 01:29:22,01:29:30然而，11年后的那一天，似乎可以肯定，一切都像好莱坞大片上演。 01:29:31,01:29:37这一事件的逻辑，物理和历史点是另一种虚假的标志运作 01:29:38,01:29:44像德国国会珍珠港轰炸和海湾东京事件01:29:46,01:29:49在美国的民意调查证实这一点： 01:29:49,01:29:57现在87％的美国人认为9/11是一个人为的借口，无尽的反恐战争 01:29:57,01:30:03并有机会去除他们的民主权利和自由。01:30:11,01:30:16>>乔治·布什: 一个接一个，恐怖分子正在学习美国正义的意义。01:30:20,01:30:24>>旁白: 但真正的威胁，美国人不是恐怖主义。 01:30:28,01:30:362001年至2009年之间，从恐怖主义的死亡数为3000。 01:30:36,01:30:41在同一时期，有192,000人死亡的凶杀案; 01:30:41,01:30:44204,000醉酒驾驶; 01:30:46,01:30:48360,000自杀; 01:30:50,01:30:53456,000二手烟; 01:30:54,01:30:59873780糖尿病; 01:31:01,01:31:074622268癌症; 01:31:10,01:31:145,304,000吸烟有关; 01:31:16,01:31:236238284心脏疾病。01:31:25,01:31:29>>布什: 今天，我们的国家遭遇了邪恶 01:31:29,01:31:32>>托尼·布莱尔: 我们不会休息，直到这个邪恶的被驱动从我们的世界 01:31:34,01:31:40>>旁白: 但是，他们的领导人只关注恐怖主义危险的幻象01:31:40,01:31:44同时允许药品和食品公司，使越来越多的有毒食品01:31:44,01:31:50被杀害的人的，像内部，潜种族灭绝的。 01:31:53,01:31:56他们甚至可以保护这些杀手锏公司： 01:31:56,01:32:03cigarettes for example are the only consumer product that doesn't have to list its ingredients on the packet. 01:32:07,01:32:14说句公道话，这将是在这样一个小盒子，难以适应2000年毒药的名称。01:32:18,01:32:23在这里，我们提醒的是，战争是没有打过仗用于标志和公民 01:32:25,01:32:28但公司。 01:32:30,01:32:37的“反恐战争”是美国宣传员，设计用来吓唬和控制他们的人 01:32:37,01:32:42是不可能赢的，但无休止地有利可图。01:32:45,01:32:55“我将早已逝去之前，一些聪明的人发现这个椭圆形办公室内发生了什么事。” - 乔治·W·布什，华盛顿，2008年5月01:32:56,01:33:00现在，革命开始01:33:02,01:33:08我们是全国唯一留在这个星球上还没有被侵略了帝国的宣传。 01:33:09,01:33:14我们并没有屈服于暴政，我们永远也不会 01:33:15,01:33:20因为我们知道什么是执政的1％是害怕： 01:33:20,01:33:23他们害怕真正的民主。 01:33:24,01:33:32他们害怕人们开始认识到他们的宣传，并开始拒绝它。01:33:32,01:33:41.500他们害怕人们会要求更多的权力，而不是冒充此种选举欺诈拍卖。 01:33:42,01:33:51他们害怕人们将开始有组织的抵抗，并拒不服从的法律，旨在削弱他们。 01:33:53,01:34:00他们害怕人们会开始问他们为什么要打仗的“财富”500强企业。 01:34:02,01:34:05他们害怕人们开始认识到 01:34:05,01:34:13.500那些对人类实施暴行的名称，不能永远躲在标志位和公司。 01:34:14,01:34:19.500They are afraid the people will gather in mass crowds and make citizen arrests01:34:20,01:34:24或者更糟。01:34:29,01:34:35.500更重要的是，他们害怕，世界将决定它想要一个新的开始01:34:36,01:34:44一场革命，有没有地方的掠夺者和强盗和剥削。 01:34:45,01:34:50我们是这个世界革命的总部！01:34:52,01:34:58以捍卫我们和平的国家和敬爱的领袖，我们将战斗到死 01:34:58,01:35:03从虐待，剥削，贪婪，01:35:03,01:35:09并从无助世界各地人民的奴役和暴力侵害。 01:35:12,01:35:20We will defend ourselves as we defend the rights of billions of humans 01:35:20,01:35:24谁不受益于500年的西方文明 01:35:24,01:35:28与企业勾结的发生癌变帝国。01:35:31,01:35:35.500我们在所有时间必须保持警觉 01:35:36,01:35:40and be alert to their insidious attack on the mind. 01:35:41,01:35:44.500For they have come before01:35:45,01:35:49他们还会再来的。
